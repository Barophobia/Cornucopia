      <header>Introduction to the linux operating system</header>
      <p>Linux is a community of open source unix like operating systems based on the linux kernel, the linux kernel was origninally released by Linus Torvalds in september 1991. It is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone commercially or noncommercially under the GNU General Public License. </p>
      <br>
      <p>When initially constructed linux was intended to be purely for personal computers but this has changed and is now the most popular operating system in the world working on mobiles,servers,mainframes etc. (pretty much anything you can think of). Arguably the largest success for linux has been Android it is based on the linux kernel and is on tablets and mobile devices all over the world.</p>
      <br>
      <header>Linux Distributions</header>
      <p>A linux distribution is an operating system made from a collection of software based on the linux kernel and a package management system (pacman, apt etc.). Most linux distributions can be downloaded online and used free of charge and can be installed like any other OS.
        <br>
        Some popular distributions are:
        <br>
        Arc
        <br>
        Manjaro
        <br>
        Ubuntu
        <br>
        Oracle
        <br>
        Redhat
        <br>
        There are many more for all sorts of situations for example some distributors create low memory images so that people with less hardware can still use the OS.
