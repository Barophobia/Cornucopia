      <p>Starting from the inside of the diagram:</p>
      <br>
      <head>Hardware Layer</head>
      <p>This layer consists of all the hardware that makes up your system for example RAM & CPU.</p>
      <br>
      <head>Kernel Layer</head>
      <p>The Kernel is a core component of linux as this is what directly communicates with the hardware of the computer.</p>
      <br>
      <head>Shell</head>
      <p>Shell is key to the architecture because it is what takes the input from the user and communicates with the kernel and then outputs the data from the kernel to the user.</p>
      <br>
      <head>Application Layer</head>
      <p>These are any applications for example the web browser</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <head><b>The Linux Kernel:</b></head>
      <p>The Linux kernel is composed of five main subsystems as shown below:</p>
      <img src='images/linux-kernel-overview.jpg'>
      <br>
      <head>Process Scheduler (SCHED)</head>
      <p>The process scheduler is responsible for controlling process access to the CPU. The scheduler enforces a policy that ensures that processes will have fair access to the CPU, while ensuring that neccessary hardware actions are performed by the kernel on time.</p>
      <br>
      <head>Memory Manager (MM)</head>
      <p>The Memory Manager permits multiple process to securely share the machines main memory system. In addition, the memory manager supports virtual memory that allows Linux to support processes that use more memory than is available to the system through hardware alone. Unused memory is swapped out to persistant storage using the file system then swapped back when it is required.</p>
      <br>
      <head>Virtual File System (VFS)</head>
      <p>The virtual file system abastracts the details of the variety of hardware devices by presenting a common file interface to all devices. In addition, the VFS supports serveral file system formats that are compatible with other operating systems.</p>
      <br>
      <head>Network interface (NET)</head>
      <p>The network interface provides access to several networking standards and a variety of network hardware.</p>
      <br>
      <head>Inter-process communication (IPC)</head>
      <p>The inter-process communication subsystem supports several mechanisms for process-to-process communication on a single linux system</p>
