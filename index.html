      <p>A tech resource</p>
      <header>What is this? </header>
      <p>This should serve as a place to get the resources you need for hardware/software.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>Why? </header>
      <p>Over the years I have kept a lot of information that helped in onenote and various other places so I thought I would use this website as a hub for all the information.<br> This is not a perfect website for everyone, I havent spent much time on it I personally made/wrote everything you see on this website (Apart from the links) and don't have much more time to format and make the website better as well as trying to learn about different technologies at the same time.<br> In the current format there is ALOT of text if you can't handle reading then this is not a good resource for you although on some pages there are video resources. 
      <br>If you use this website I would read the information and try to get some physical experience with the technology for example looking at what subnet the network you are on uses if you are researching subnetting or composing your own Dockerfile is you are researching docker.</p>
