        <header>The windows core:</header>
        <p>The products that microsoft currently provide are now supported under one single API this allows a developer to use a single codebase instead of shared codebases across multiple platforms.</p>
      <header>How convergence works:</header>
      <p>The converged kernel is a kernel that allows the current products that microsoft makes (Windows, Xbox One, Windows mobiles in various versions) to run what microsoft are calling 'universal apps' this means when you develop a UAP (universal app platform) application you can move it across different devices. </p>

      <header></header>
      <header>Universal App Platform:</header>
      <p>The UAP is a collection of contracts and versions. This is the new platform on which developers will be writing their applications. The UAP is built on the Windows Core that is a collection of Low-Level APIs that are arranged in the form of Contracts.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>Contracts</header>
      <p>Contracts are a kind of assurance given by Microsoft to App Developers stating that they can now start building using the UAP. Microsoft will ensure that no matter what Windows platform and device the users are on, they will be able to run it and Microsoft will ensure that the App runs smoothly on the previous compatible version as well. This means developers will not develop targetting windows and instead use the UAP to make their app as cross-compatible as possible.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>Why has this been implemented?</header>
      <p>In a usual development environment where you are targeting windows you would have to test your application on multiple versions of OS and pre-requisites, using the UAP allows the developers to stop spending as much time testing because they can handle the target versions and it 'should' work from there.</p>
