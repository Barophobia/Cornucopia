## Data Collected :
NONE.

I don't believe in the collection of your data at all so I do not and will never collect any data from users.

### Caveat
This website is hosted on Azure and the theme is created by Google (although heavily modified) so there may be data collection from their respective sides but I will never see this and do not have control over this.

Privacy on the internet is important to me so if you have any questions please contact me through Github and I will answer as soon as I can.
