      <header>What is WDS? </header>
      <p>WDS (Windows Deployment Services) is a server technology used to deploy images to a client through the network. To install WDS to a server you must install the WDS role in the server manager application.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>Load management</header>
      <p>When installing the WDS role onto a server you may notice that you have to install the 'deployment server' as well as the 'transport server', if you are planning to deploy an image through WDS using PXE boot to a lot of users then it may be a good idea to have multiple transport servers this can be installed independently to other servers to allow you to load balance the services.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>Configuration of WDS</header>
      <p>If you open the WDS application you should notice that you have a WDS server under the server drop down, when you first install WDS this will have a yellow exclamation point on the server, to fix this right click the server and click 'configure' you will then get the configuration manager usually inside here you would pick the integrated Active Directory option. <br> after that has been chosen you should be greeted with the remote installation folder path you can change this to wherever you want although it is not recommended to be on the C: drive (The remote installation path is where the images and configuration will be stored)<br> you will now be asked to choose which clients you respond to this is a personal choice and will be based on your environment.<br> after this is complete you will be asked if you want to add images to the server now, if you choose yes you will be greeted with the 'add image wizard' this is where you will add the image you want to deploy. <br>
      browse to wherever your image is stored and use that, then you will be asked to name the image group this is up to you <br> from the next screen you can see the boot images and install images based on the image you provided.<br> Once the image is added you should be able to find the boot images and install images inside your WDS app.<br>
      now as long as you have DHCP setup correctly for clients you should be able to PXE boot to deploy your image.<br> if you havent setup DHCP then you should install the DHCP role to a server of your choice and open the DHCP app then look inside your IPv4 Scopes and add a new scope option the options you need is: <br> <b>Option 66:boot server host name (Value: WDS Server address)<br> Option 67: Bootfile name (Value: the bootfile name on your WDS server) </b><br> now right click the scope and choose 'activate' <br>now you should be able to boot through PXE and deploy your image.</p>
