      <p>You can go into 'about your PC' and it will show you some hardware and software information as well as the OS information under the Windows Specification section.</p>
      <header>Installing Windows from scratch:</headeR>
      <p><a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10?irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_159229&tduid=%28ir__3dhe1fwme0kftlgukk0sohz3x32xng1ewlks1gap00%29%287593%29%28159229%29%28%29%28UUwpUdUnU33049YYwYg%29&irclickid=_3dhe1fwme0kftlgukk0sohz3x32xng1ewlks1gap00'>Official Microsoft W10 ISO</a></p>
      <p>To install windows from scratch you will need a DVD or ISO that you can mount on your system, from here boot to the media. <br> Once you are into the windows 10 media setup Choose your language and click 'next' <br> from here click the 'install now' button and you will be prompted to type in your CD Key (There is an option here to skip the input) <br> Next you may get a screen asking what edition of windows 10 you would like to install, this can be determined by looking at the editions table close to the top of the page, once you have chosen click 'next'. <br>
      In the next screen there are the terms and conditions click the 'i agree' checkbox and then click 'next' <br> from here you need to know wether you want to upgrade (Used if you want to keep files,apps and setting) or you want a fresh install which is under the 'custom' option. <br> when you choose 'custom' it will ask what drive you want to use as your main drive, choose the appropriate drive (You may want to format the drive) and then click next. <br> from here windows will install and once complete you will be greeted with more setup, first choose your region, then your keyboard region, skip the second keyboard layout if you are only using one keyboard. <br> now you will be asked if you want to set up for personal use or for an organization, this guide is for personal use so chooce 'personal use' <br>
      Now you will be prompted to login with a microsoft account (You do not have to do this as you could choose to make a local account known as an 'offline account') choose whatever suits your needs and continue through the user account process. Next you will be asked to crete a PIN, this will be used for login purposes, throughout the installation you will be offered a lot of 'features' which will personalise your experience with windows personally I do not use them and would recommend to anyone to say 'no' to these. <br>
      After you have completed through this setup you are nearly complete, it is recommended to check if your PC has any updates available so that you have the newest version and the best security for your computer. <br> Once the updates are complete you are done with the installation.</p>
    <br>
    <header>How to reset windows 10:</header>
    <p>To reset windows go to the 'start' menu and click the cog in the bottom left. this will open the settings page, if you then choose the 'updates & security' option and go to the 'recovery' tab the options to reset your PC will be there. <bR> there are 2 options for recovery you can either reset your computer fully so that there are no files,app or settings or you can choose to keep the files,app and settings or whatever of these you choose.</p>
    <header>Cleaning old system files:</header>
    <p>If you open the start menu and type 'disk cleanup' it will allow you to open the disk cleanup application once that is open you can choose to clean old system files there and delete them. These are usually kept so if you upgrade your computer and find that you have some issues due to the upgrade you can downgrade from that version, it is recommended to keep the files for a while after you upgrade just make sure that the upgraded version works with everything you require, due to UAP (explained in the architecture page) you should not notice applications breaking because of upgrades as often as you would in previous OS's.</p>
    <br>
    <headeR>Changing your language:</headeR>
    <p>Languages can be chosen when deploying a client but in some circumstances a language may need to be changed after the device has already been deployed to do this go to <br><B>Settings<br>Time & Language<br>Language tab</B><br> from here you can add or change the language on the device with many being offered on the microsoft store if they are not part of your standard installation.</p>
    <header>Showing Hidden Files</header>
    <p>There are  multiple reasons you may need to view hidden files for example viewing hidden application files. to do this: <br><b>Open File Explorer<br>Click 'View' at the top <br>Check the box 'Hidden items'</b></p>
