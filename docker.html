      <header> Docker </header>
      <header>What is Docker? </header>
      <p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications, it uses OS Level virtualisation to deliver software and packages that are known as containers. Using docker allows you to have scalability instead of having to have multiple physical servers that could be in containers on one physical server.</p>
      <header>How to get started with docker:</header>
      <p>The docker docs website has a lot of documentation and allows you to get a very good understanding of the product and how it works. I would recommend <p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/">Getting started with docker</p></p></a>
      <br><p>Docker has 2 requirements to stand a containers host, one is the containers feature in windows server on the container host as well as docker.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>How to install Docker:</header>
      <p>Begin with installing the containers feature on windows server (This can be skipped if you are installing docker through powershell with internet access)<br>
      To install docker through Powershell you can type:<br>
      Install-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider -Repository PSGallery -Force <br>
      Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Verbose<br>
      <br>
      Verbose does not have to be on the end of the last command but it allows you to view what is happening whilst it is installing.
      After installing docker or activating the containers feature you should restart your machine to enable containers correctly.<br>
      Once docker is installed you can check that it is running in the services applet or by typing <br>Get-Service Docker <br>into powershell.</p>
      <header>How to update docker:</header>
      <p>You can update docker by typing into powershell <br>Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Update -Verbose </p>
      <header>Where to find open source Docker Containers:</header>
      <p>Docker hosts a 'hub' that allows you to download containers that other people have created and use them in your own envrionment <p><a href='https://hub.docker.com/'>Docker Hub</a></p></p>
      <header>Video Resources:</header>
      <p>If you are more of a visual learner there is a 2 hour video that will teach you the basics of docker <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo'><p>here</p></a></p></a></p>
      <header>Containers:</header> 
      <p>The code and environment you use in the build file is what will make up the environment this does not make it a full virtual machine though using docker allows you to remove a lot of the overhead needed with virtual machines which means it will be much more efficient. </p>
      <header>Dockerfile:</header> 
      <p>A dockerfile is a document of code written in steps for how you want the image the docker container uses and the process it needs to go through to be built in the specific way you want. Once this dockerfile is built it gives you the image which is then used to run the container.
      <br>An example of a basic docker file would be -<br> 
        
        FROM php:7.0-apache<br> 
        COPY X X2<br>
        EXPOSE 80 <br>
      </p>  
      <header>Explained:</header> 
      <p>First line - Using the FROM basically means you put in whatever image and tag you want to use the PHP is the image and 7.0-apache is the tag for the image I want to use because the official image has multiple different versions of PHP with apache<br>
      Second line - COPY is used to move the files from your computer to the new image so for a PHP webserver you would most likely want to move your website from X (being the folder your website is in on your computer) to X2 (being the folder on the new webserver (this is most likely /var/www/html))<bR>
      Third line - The EXPOSE line just means that whatever port number you put after it will be exposed to the internet so port 80 is used here because a webserver is being made.<br>
      <br>
      These dockerfiles can get a lot more advanced but this basic example works for a very basic webserver.</p>
      <header>Building using a Dockerfile:</header> 
      <p>To build your newly created Dockerfile into an image that you can use for a containter you will need to 'build' it. To do this go into a terminal and CD to the Dockerfile folder 
      <br>Inside the folder in the terminal type: docker build -t *Name you want for output image*
      <br>This will build the image for your container using the exact parameters you set inside the dockerfile, once it is complete you will see the image inside the folder. </p>
      <header>Running your new container:</header> 
      <p>Now that your image has been built you can run it using the 'docker run' command
      <br>docker run *name of image*
      <br>If you are building a webserver you will need to forward the port from the host machine to this container this is done my including a flag in the command
      <br>docker run -p 80:80 *name of image*
      <br>This will then run the image in a container
      <header>Managing Volumes in a container:</header>
      <p>A volume or storage location can be added to a container so that the container can have the data from the volume given, as I am using the example of a webserver I will continue with this. If you have built and run the webserver and hosted a website you will see that the webserver will not automatically update, this is because when you build the image it takes the data from the point that you built the image so if you were to change the file given to the Dockerfile then the image will not get that until you re-build the image, a way around this so that you have a live view would be to use a volume,
      this gives the container live access to the data. to do this you need to use the '-V' flag example shown below - <br> docker run -p 80:80 <b>-V *data on host*:*destination in container*</b> *name of image* <br> Real world example <br> docker run -p 80:80 -V docker/html:/var/www/html testdocker <br> The above examples are the same one is just filled out with the information so you can see how it would look in a normal way. If you run this container you will then be able to see that the container keeps updating with the application/website you are hosting.
