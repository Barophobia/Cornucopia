      <header>Why should I learn this?</header>
      <p>Any one starting to learn about computer networking will be faced with learning about the OSI and TCP/IP networking models, and the TCP/IP protocol suite.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>What is a protocol?</header>
      <p>A protocol is a set of rules that govern how systems communicate. For networking they govern how data is transferred from one system to another.</p>
      <header></header>
      <header>What is TCP/IP? </header>
      <p>TCP/IP, or the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or an extranet). The Defense Data Network, part of the Department of Defense, developed TCP/IP, and it has been widely adopted as a networking standard.</p>
      <header></header>
      <p>The TCP/IP relationship is similar to sending someone a message written on a puzzle through the mail. The message is written down and the puzzle is broken into pieces. Each piece then can travel through a different postal route, some of which take longer than others. When the puzzle pieces arrive after traversing their different paths, the pieces may be out of order. The Internet Protocol makes sure the pieces arrive at their destination address. The TCP protocol can be thought of as the puzzle assembler on the other side who puts the pieces together in the right order, asks for missing pieces to be resent, and lets the sender know the puzzle has been received. TCP maintains the connection with the sender from before the first puzzle piece is sent to after the final piece is sent.</p>
      <header></header>
      <p>IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that each unit of data is individually addressed and routed from the source device to the target device, and the target does not send an acknowledgement back to the source. Thatâ€™s where protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) come in. TCP is used in conjunction with IP in order to maintain a connection between the sender and the target and to ensure packet order.</p>
