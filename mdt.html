      <header>What is MDT? </header>
      <p>MDT can help build an automated installation source for deploying Windows operating systems from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 onwards, from either a single machine or a central server distribution tool, such as Windows Deployment Services (WDS) or System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). Device drivers, Windows updates and software can be included with the build.</p>
      <br></br>
      <header>Installation types:</header>
      <p>Zero Touch installation: Installation without having to touch the deployment.<br>
      Lite Touch Installation: This makes the deployment process simple but you still have to touch the installation at certain points<br>
      In-place Upgrade: This allows you to upgrade clients that are currently in the environment for example from 8.1 to 10<br>
      </p>
